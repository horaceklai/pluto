# Pluto the Robo Dog

The vision of this open source project is to design a quadruple robot 
with 3 joints in each leg that is:
* manufacturable with a 3d printer, commonly available fasteners and 
bearings, and commonly used hand tools
* radio controlled by a gamepad
* cheap, BOM totalling under 300 USD
* the basis of many inspiring pet dog projects!
